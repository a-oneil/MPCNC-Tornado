## Description
When I build my MPCNC, I was looking for a decent dust collection system that was Z axis independent. All of the designs I've found on thingiverse or the V1 Engineering forums moved the dust shoe up and down with the router when it moved. I determined that I was going to design an assembly from scratch that would allow you to set the height of the dust shoe and lock it in so it doesn’t move when running the CNC. 

My design has two "sliders" that attach to the core via M3 Heated Inserts and M3 16mm machine screws. The dust shoe is held in by 8, 8mmx3mm magnets and allows you to easily remove the shoe when setting up your work piece.

Feel free to remix my design, I’m open to suggestions on how I can make this a better system.

Additional assembly instructions, parts list and design discussion can be found at the following link on the [V1 Engineering forums.](https://forum.v1e.com/t/mpcnc-primo-tornado-z-independent-dust-collection/22054/1
)

## Installation
1. Hold the sliders up to the core and mark the holes.
2. Take off your router out of the core assembly. 
3. Take a drill bit that matches the size of the M3 heated inserts and drill into the core. 
4. At this point, we can take our inserts press them in using a soldering iron. I used 300C on my soldering iron to do this.
5. Take the M3 16mm screws and washers and attach the slider to the core.
6. You will want to go ahead and press in the magnets into the arms and dust shoe after attaching the slider to the core. (Make sure your magnets are in the correct orientation)
7. Once the magnets are in, take the square M3 nut and place it into the slot on the back of the slider rail. Take an arm assembly and an M3 45mm and washer and attach the arm to the core, don’t crank it down. Repeat for the other side.
8. Finally, take your Easy Cut Strip brush and press it into the dust shoe. At this point, you should be able to slide it into the two arms and test it out.
