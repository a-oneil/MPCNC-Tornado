## Description
When I build my MPCNC, I was looking for a decent dust collection system that was Z axis independent. All of the designs I've found on thingiverse and the V1 Engineering forums moved the dust shoe up and down with the router when it moved. 

I determined I was going to design an assembly that would allow you to set the height of the dust shoe and lock it in so it doesnâ€™t move when running the CNC. The dust shoe is held in by 8, 8mmx3mm magnets and allows you to easily remove the shoe when setting up your work piece.
